			I'm using this to further my knowledge and experience with web programming, using various technologies. Currently this is primarily an exercise in front-end development, due to the static nature of git-pages. However, in time, I may include some back-end code here, though this is much more likely to appear in other repositories.

			Eventually, I expect to transform this fully into a portfolio website - this is currently in the "beta" (i.e. broken) stage of development, but it is accessible under the <a href="portfolio_beta">portfolio_beta</a> route. This is an incomplete (and rather unprofessional-looking) version of the page, so do not expect everything to appear perfectly.
